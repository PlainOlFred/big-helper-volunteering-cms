## Testing
This application relies on the Jest React Testing Library. To test this: 
1. Navigate to the client folder and run `npm run test` 
## Future Development
There was a lot I wanted to accomplish in a short time with this application, which leaves room for future development. 
Currently, the project creation is fully functional. This core feature creates projects, assigns tasks to projects and edits tasks for projects, by saving and updating information to the SQL database and then displaying them to in the React server. 
For future development I plan to add login functionality that separates admins from volunteers and save their information into the database. Admins will have the ability to assign work and verify that tasks are completed, while volunteers can submit tasks for review. 
I am also working on the charity profiles feature. This would be for admins so they can manage multiple projects and group them by charity.
